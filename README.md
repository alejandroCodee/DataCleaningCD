## Problem Statement
The main problem of this project is cleaning the Excel file provided by Casa David, 
which contains records from a Google Form. The data was entered manually, leading to a large amount of inconsistent, 
duplicate, incoherent, and generally very dirty data. As a result, it was not possible to generate meaningful reports.

## Data Source
- Exported Google Forms file

## Methods
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
- Power BI Dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python (PANDAS)
- Power BI and Power Query
- Excel

## Data Visualization

The generated dashboard is 100% interactive, with precise and clean data.

## Limitations and what can be improved
- Obtain data from different hospitals where Casa David works to have national data.
- Work with more complex graphs to obtain descriptive statistics.
- During the cleanup, some records had to be removed.
