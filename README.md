## Problem Statement
The main problem of this project is cleaning the Excel file provided by Casa David, 
which contains records from a Google Form. The data was entered manually, leading to a large amount of inconsistent, 
duplicate, incoherent, and generally very dirty data. As a result, it was not possible to generate meaningful reports.
